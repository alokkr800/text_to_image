# 🖼️ Text-to-Image Generation System

Imagine typing **any description** – from *“a cat sitting on a book”* to *“a physics diagram of a pendulum”* – and instantly seeing it transform into a **visual image**.  
That’s exactly what this project does! 🚀  

This is an **AI-powered text-to-image generator** built with **Stable Diffusion** and **Hugging Face Diffusers**.  
It comes with a **Flask-powered web application** where users can write prompts, generate images, preview them, and download with a single click.
